# LocalPDF-Chat-RAG-
LocalPDF-Chat is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content through an interactive chat interface. Instead of sending data to external APIs or cloud services, the system processes documents fully on the local machine using open-source language models.
